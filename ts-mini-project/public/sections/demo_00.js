/**
 * ====================================================
 * TypeScript Fundamentals â€“ Practice Playground
 * ====================================================
 *
 * This file serves as a hands-on sandbox for exploring:
 *
 * Core Concepts:
 *  - TypeScript's primitive & reference types
 *  - Variable declarations (let, const, type inference)
 *  - Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow funcs
 *  - Arrays, tuples, readonly arrays
 *  - Objects, interfaces, and type aliases
 *  - Enums: numeric & string enums
 *  - Literal types, union and intersection types
 *  - Type guards and type assertions
 *  - Control flow (if, switch, for, while, etc.)
 *  - Nullish coalescing, optional chaining
 *
 * Intermediate:
 *  - Interfaces vs. type aliases
 *  - Functions with optional/default/rest params
 *  - Discriminated unions
 *  - keyof, typeof, infer
 *  - Working with 'unknown' and 'never'
 *  - Type narrowing with guards and conditionals
 *  - Basic error handling
 *
 * dvanced & Utility Types:
 *  - Generics (functions, types, interfaces, classes)
 *  - Mapped types, conditional types
 *  - Partial, Required, Readonly, Record, Pick, Omit
 *  - Recursive types and deeply nested structures
 *  - Custom utility types
 *
 * Config & Tooling:
 *  - tsconfig.json basics
 *  - Module resolution, strict mode
 *  - Source maps & debugging tips
 *
 * Purpose:
 *  - Reinforce TypeScript syntax and principles
 *  - Test behavior of the type system
 *  - Explore language features in isolation
 *  - Keep a running reference of core TS knowledge
 *
 * Note:
 *  This file is standalone and not used by the app.
 *  It exists purely for self-directed practice and experimentation.
